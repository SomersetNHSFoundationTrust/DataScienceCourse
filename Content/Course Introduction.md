## Course Introduction

This course is aimed at experienced Health and Social Care Data Professionals who would like to explore a career or better understand concepts in Data Science. 

**Prerequisites**

Whilst our course is designed as an entry level course, we recommend the following experience

- Experience in using programming languages (preferably R or Python) or SQL

- Maths at GCSE level 4+ or a C grade and above

- Approximately two hours per week for revision in addition to the course (three weeks)

Students will need access to Python 3.8+ and Jupyter running on an environment that has the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file located here installed: 

We recommend that if you do not have Python currently installed that you use the Miniconda instance of Python. 

**Program Timetable**

The course is delivered in person over a three week time period. We recommend, where possible to deliver the training as a block so that students are able to retain information between modules.

**Optional Modules**

Candidates can choose two optional modules which cover specific concepts of Data Science in week two. This is aimed to allow students to focus on areas that they are able to take back to their places of work. 

- Classification & Regression

- Network Analysis

- Time Series Modelling

- Simulation Modelling

- Unsupervised Learning (Anomaly Detection & Clustering)

- Causal Inference (Measuring Change)

- Object Orientated Design

- Geospatial Analysis
